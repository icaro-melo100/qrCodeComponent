## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this little project to learn and train about flexy boxes.

This is a great way to mantain an organized website.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  flex-direction: column;
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  align-content: center;
}

.container-div {
  flex: 0 1 auto;
  align-self: auto;
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 20px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  align-content: center;
  text-align: justify;
  width: 325px;
}
```

### Continued development

After this, I want to improve my skills with responsive websites.

Besides, developing more complex websites.
